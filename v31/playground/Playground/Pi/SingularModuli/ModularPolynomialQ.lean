# The modular polynomial `Φ_m ∈ ℚ[X, Y]` (Phase C, chunks B3–B5)

Third file of Track 1 of Phase C (see `Playground/Pi/PhaseC-PLAN.md`, §3.1 sub-lemmas
`(B3)`–`(B5)`, §6.4). This is the **keystone** of the whole singular-moduli program: every
downstream statement funnels through the identity `Φ_m(X, j τ) = ∏_i (X − f_i τ)` with
`ℚ`-coefficients, and no route avoids it.

For a **prime** `m` (kept generic; `m ∈ {41, 43, 61, 163}` are instantiated later) the file
builds, from the `m`-isogeny coset orbit `f m i` of `CosetOrbit.lean`:

* **(A) Root-of-unity averaging** `sum_zetaM_zpow_mul`
  (`∑_{b : ZMod m} ζ^{b·n} = m·[m ∣ n]`), the arithmetic heart of `(B3)`: it kills every
  power of the base variable `w` that is not a genuine power of the nome `q = w^m`. Proved
  in full.
* **(B) Power sums** `powerSum m k τ = ∑_i (f m i τ)^k`: `SL(2,ℤ)`-invariance
  (`powerSum_smul`, from the `S`/`T`-permutations of the orbit) and holomorphy
  (`mdifferentiable_powerSum`). Proved in full. Likewise the orbit polynomial
  `orbitPoly m τ = ∏_i (X − f_i τ)` and the `SL(2,ℤ)`-invariance / holomorphy of its
  coefficients (the elementary symmetric functions of the orbit).
* **(B4/B5) The q-expansion principle** `Sk_eq_poly_j` (the critical lemma): an
  `SL(2,ℤ)`-invariant, holomorphic function that is *meromorphic of finite order at the
  cusp with coefficients in a subring `R ⊆ ℂ`* is a polynomial in `j` of bounded degree
  with `R`-coefficients. Proved by **pole-order induction with coefficient tracking**; the
  algebraic heart (leading-coefficient cancellation against `j^N`, coefficients staying in
  `R`) is unconditional, and the two genuinely-analytic primitives — the *removable
  singularity / pole-reduction* step and the *Liouville base case* (bounded + invariant +
  holomorphic ⇒ constant) — are **gated behind explicit hypotheses**, `Valence.lean`-style,
  with their routes documented. (See `PhaseC-PLAN.md` §6.4 / §6.6: the base case is the
  plan-sanctioned single gate.)
* **(B5) Assembly** `PhiQ`: gated on `Sk_eq_poly_j` + the `(B3)` q-expansion structure, the
  modular polynomial `Φ_m ∈ ℚ[X][Y]` with `Φ_m(X, j τ) = ∏_i (X − f_i τ)`.

## Status of the analytic gates (see `PhaseC-PLAN.md` §6.4)

`Sk_eq_poly_j` and `PhiQ` take the deep analytic facts as hypotheses rather than `sorry`.
The whole file is **sorry-free**. The gated pieces, with routes, are documented at their
`TODO` blocks:

1. `poleReduction` — the removable-singularity step: subtracting `c·j^N` from a pole-order-`N`
   cusp-meromorphic function yields a pole-order-`(N−1)` one. Route: the cusp function of
   `(h − c j^N)·q^N` is analytic at `0` with value `0`, hence `= w·(analytic)`, so dividing
   by one power of the nome stays bounded. Mathlib: `AnalyticAt`, `cuspFunction`, the
   `qExpansion` ring-hom API of `NumberTheory/ModularForms/QExpansion.lean`.
2. `liouvilleBaseCase` — bounded + `SL(2,ℤ)`-invariant + holomorphic ⇒ constant. Route
   (`PhaseC-PLAN.md` §6.4): descend to the disc via the cusp function, use
   `exists_smul_mem_fd_j` (from `Valence.lean`) to reduce every value to a compact truncation
   of the fundamental domain, and conclude via the open-mapping / clopen argument.
3. `(B3)` q-expansion structure of the power sums (the `w`-averaging producing the honest
   `q`-Laurent expansion with `ℚ`-coefficients and finite pole order) — the input to `PhiQ`,
   documented at `PhiQ`.

/-! ## (A) Root-of-unity averaging

The clean arithmetic fact powering `(B3)`: summing `ζ^{b·n}` over `b : ZMod m` (with
`ζ = zetaM m = exp(2πi/m)`) gives `m` when `m ∣ n` and `0` otherwise. In the `w`-expansion
of the orbit this averages the coset variable `ζ^b·w` down to the honest nome `q = w^m`. -/

/-! ## (B4/B5) The q-expansion principle `Sk_eq_poly_j`

The critical lemma of the whole singular-moduli program (`PhaseC-PLAN.md` §6.4). It says:
an `SL(2,ℤ)`-invariant, holomorphic function that is *meromorphic of finite order at the
cusp with coefficients in a subring `R ⊆ ℂ`* equals a polynomial in `j` of bounded degree
with `R`-coefficients. The proof is a **pole-order downward induction with coefficient
tracking**: the leading Laurent coefficient `c` lies in `R`; since `j = q⁻¹(1 + 744q + …)`
is monic with integer q-expansion, `h − c·jᴺ` has strictly smaller pole order while keeping
`R`-coefficients; the base case `N = 0` is bounded + invariant + holomorphic, hence
constant (Liouville).

### Cusp-meromorphy data

We package "meromorphic at the cusp, pole order `≤ N`, coefficients in `R`" as the property
that `τ ↦ h τ · q τ ^ N` is a genuine holomorphic q-expansion function (`1`-periodic on the
disc side, holomorphic on `ℍ`, bounded at `i∞`) whose q-expansion has all coefficients in
`R`. Then `h = q⁻ᴺ · (that holomorphic function)` is exactly a Laurent series of pole order
`≤ N` with `R`-coefficients. -/

/-- `h` is *cusp-meromorphic of pole order `≤ N` with `R`-coefficients*: the product
`h · qᴺ` is a holomorphic function with a `q`-expansion whose coefficients all lie in the

TODO (analytic gate 1 — the Liouville base case; `PhaseC-PLAN.md` §6.4).

`liouvilleBaseCase` below is the plan-sanctioned base-case gate (`PhaseC-PLAN.md` §6.4): a
bounded, `SL(2,ℤ)`-invariant, holomorphic function on `ℍ` is constant. Route to discharge it:

  * `IsCuspMeroR h 0 R` gives that `h` itself is `1`-periodic, holomorphic and bounded at
    `i∞`, so its cusp function `H := cuspFunction 1 h` is analytic on the unit disc
    (`analyticAt_cuspFunction_zero`) and `h τ = H (q τ)` with `q τ → 0` at `i∞`.
  * `SL(2,ℤ)`-invariance + `exists_smul_mem_fd_j` (`Valence.lean`) reduce every value of `h`
    to the closed fundamental domain; splitting `𝒟` into the compact truncation
    `𝒟 ∩ {Im ≤ T}` and the cusp neighbourhood `{Im > T}` (where `h = H ∘ q` with `q` in a
    small disc), `h(ℍ)` is contained in a compact set.
  * If `h` were nonconstant, `H` would be a nonconstant analytic function, hence open
    (open-mapping theorem), so `H(disc)` — which contains `h(ℍ)` — would be open; a nonempty
    open *and* compact subset of the connected space `ℂ` is impossible. Hence `h` is constant,
    equal to its q-expansion constant term `= cuspLeadCoeff h 0 ∈ R`.

Mathlib assets: `analyticAt_cuspFunction_zero`, `cuspFunction_apply_zero`,
`AnalyticAt.eventually_eq_or_...`/open-mapping (`Analysis/Complex/OpenMapping`),
`ModularGroup.exists_smul_mem_fd`, compactness of the truncated fundamental domain.

TODO (analytic gate 2 — the pole-reduction / removable-singularity step).

`poleReduction` below states that subtracting `c · j^{N+1}` (with `c` the leading Laurent
coefficient) from a pole-order-`(N+1)` cusp-meromorphic function yields a pole-order-`N`
one, still with `R`-coefficients. Route: the cusp function of `(h − c·j^{N+1})·q^{N+1}`
equals `cuspFunction(h·q^{N+1}) − c·(jqInt)^{N+1}`-expansion, which is analytic at `0` with
value `c − c·1 = 0` (using `constantCoeff_jqInt = 1` from `JFunction.lean`); an analytic
germ vanishing at `0` is `w · (analytic)`, so dividing by one power of the nome keeps the
function bounded, giving `IsCuspMeroR … N R`. Coefficient tracking: the `q`-expansion of the
reduced `h·q^{N+1}` is `qExpansion(h·q^{N+1}) − c·(jqInt)^{N+1}` (a difference of `R`-series,
since `jqInt` has ℤ-coefficients and `ℤ ⊆ R`), and dividing by `X` shifts coefficients,
staying in `R`. Mathlib assets: the `qExpansion` ring-hom API (`qExpansion_mul`,
`qExpansion_sub`, `qExpansion_smul`) of `NumberTheory/ModularForms/QExpansion.lean`, and
`PowerSeries.X`-cancellation. This is the "coefficient-tracking" bookkeeping of §6.4.
-/

/-- **Liouville base case (analytic gate 1 — now discharged).** A holomorphic, `SL(2,ℤ)`-invariant
function on `ℍ` that is cusp-meromorphic of pole order `≤ 0` with `R`-coefficients (i.e. `1`-periodic,
holomorphic and bounded at `i∞`, its q-expansion having coefficients in `R`) is **constant**, and its
value is the q-expansion constant term, which lies in `R`.

**Route** (maximum modulus, `PhaseC-PLAN.md` §6.4). Descend to the unit disc via the cusp function
`H := cuspFunction 1 h`, which is analytic on `Metric.ball 0 1` (`differentiableOn_cuspFunction_ball`)
and satisfies `H (q τ) = h τ` (`eq_cuspFunction`). By `SL(2,ℤ)`-invariance and the fundamental-domain
reduction `ModularGroup.exists_smul_mem_fd`, every value `H z` on the punctured disc is *matched in
modulus* by a value `H w` with `‖w‖ ≤ e^{-π}`: the pre-image `τ` of `z ≠ 0` moves into `𝒟`, where
`3 ≤ 4·(Im)²` forces `Im ≥ 1/2` and hence `‖q‖ ≤ e^{-π}`. The maximum-modulus principle in the form
`Complex.eq_const_of_exists_le` then makes `H` constant on the whole disc, so `h τ = H 0`; and
`H 0 = (qExpansion 1 h).coeff 0 ∈ R` by `cuspFunction_apply_zero` / `qExpansion_coeff_zero`. -/

/-! ## (B5) Assembly: the modular polynomial `Φ_m ∈ ℚ[X][Y]`

The `SL(2,ℤ)`-invariant coefficients of `orbitPoly m τ = ∏_i (X − f_i τ)` are the elementary
symmetric functions of the orbit. Feeding each (via Newton's identities from the power sums,
plus `Sk_eq_poly_j`) to the q-expansion principle expresses it as a `ℚ`-polynomial in `j`.
Packaging those `ℚ`-polynomials as the `Y`-coefficients yields `Φ_m ∈ ℚ[Y][X]` with the
defining identity `Φ_m(X, j τ) = ∏_i (X − f_i τ)`.

Here we deliver the **final packaging step** unconditionally: given the per-coefficient
`ℚ`-rationality (`hrat`, the output of `(B3)` + `Sk_eq_poly_j`), we build `Φ_m` and prove the
identity. -/

/-! ## Analytic gate 2 (pole reduction): `poleReduction`

This appended section discharges the `step` hypothesis of `Sk_eq_poly_j` — the
removable-singularity / pole-order-reduction step. Given `h` cusp-meromorphic of pole order
`≤ N+1` with `R`-coefficients and leading Laurent coefficient `c = cuspLeadCoeff h (N+1)`, the
function `h − c·j^{N+1}` is cusp-meromorphic of pole order `≤ N` with `R`-coefficients.

The analytic heart is the general lemma `divByQ`: if `F` is a holomorphic `q`-expansion function
whose expansion has zero constant term, then `F/q` is again such a function, with `q`-expansion
coefficients shifted down by one (`dslope`/removable-singularity at the cusp). The algebraic heart
(`j·q` has integer `q`-expansion with leading coefficient `1`, so the `q^{-(N+1)}` term cancels and
all coefficients stay in `R`) is done via the `qExpansion` ring-hom API from `JFunction.lean`. -/

/-! ## (B3) The power sums are cusp-meromorphic with `ℚ`-coefficients

This appended section discharges the last remaining gate of the keystone: the `hrat` input of
`exists_PhiQ`. For a **prime** `m`, every power sum `powerSum m k` is `SL(2,ℤ)`-invariant,
holomorphic and cusp-meromorphic of pole order `≤ m·k` with `ℚ` (indeed `ℤ`)-coefficients, hence
(via `Sk_eq_poly_j_closed`) a `ℚ`-polynomial in `j`. Newton's identities then push this to the
elementary symmetric functions (the orbit-polynomial coefficients), delivering the unconditional
keystone `exists_PhiQ_closed`.

The analytic heart is the **root-of-unity averaging** `sum_zetaM_zpow_mul`: writing each orbit
value's `q`-expansion in the honest base variable `w = wParam m τ` (with `w^m = q τ`), the
coset points contribute `w`-powers `ζ^{b·n}` whose `b`-sum collapses to a genuine `q`-Laurent
series. -/
