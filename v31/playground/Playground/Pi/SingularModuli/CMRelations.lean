# The CM relations at `τ₁₆₃`: explicit isogeny matrices (Phase C, Track 3)

This file provides the **input-side** data of `PhaseC-PLAN.md` (B8)/(C2): for each
`m ∈ {41, 43, 61}` an explicit integer matrix of determinant `m` fixing `τ₁₆₃` as a Möbius
transformation.  These are the `m`-isogenies of the CM lattice with itself; downstream
(`CMRelations`/`Rationality` in the plan) they witness `Φ_m(j₀, j₀) = 0` and, via
`FormReduction.disc_of_three_relations`, pin the discriminant `D₀ = −163`.

The matrix is `M_n = ![![n+1, −41],![1, n]]` (in the `(a,b,c,d)` convention `M • τ =
(aτ+b)/(cτ+d)`), fixing `τ₁₆₃` because `τ² = τ − 41` (from `41 − τ + τ² = 0`):

* `det M_n = n² + n + 41` — the norm form `x² + xy + 41 y²` at `(x,y) = (n, 1)`;
* `tr M_n = 2n + 1`, and `tr² − 4·det = −163` (the multiplier `λ = 1` throughout);
* the instances `n = 0, 1, 4` give determinants `41, 43, 61` — the minimal working triple
  (§6.6: `{41,43,47}` fails, `−43` survives).

Only elementary Möbius algebra is used; nothing here touches the modular polynomial `Φ_m`
itself (that is `ModularPolynomialQ`, another track).

multiplier for `M_n` is `k = 1`, and the determinant equals

/-- The three determinants are represented by the norm form `x² + xy + 41 y²` at
`(x, y) = (0,1), (1,1), (4,1)` — the arithmetic reason the isogenies exist (`m` splits in
the order `ℤ[τ₁₆₃]`). -/

/-- **The three-prime input, packaged for the rationality argument.** The traces
`t = 2n+1` for `n = 0, 1, 4` and multiplier `λ = 1` satisfy the discriminant relations
`t² − 4m = (−163)·λ²` at `m = 41, 43, 61`; feeding these to
`FormReduction.disc_of_three_relations` re-derives `D₀ = −163`.  (Here it is a tautological
consistency check, since `D₀ = −163` is the discriminant of `τ₁₆₃`; downstream the same
shape is applied to an *a priori unknown* common CM point.) -/

    ((2 * 0 + 1 : ℤ) ^ 2 - 4 * 41 = -163 * 1 ^ 2) ∧
