# Singular moduli at `τ₁₆₃`: the cited arithmetic inputs (Phase C)

Milla's paper (arXiv:1809.00533v6) does *not* prove the following three statements;
it cites them from the literature, and they are the main open risk of this
formalization (PLAN Phase C):

1. `isIntegral_j_τ₁₆₃` : `j(τ₁₆₃) = 1728·J(τ₁₆₃)` is an algebraic integer
   [Silverman, *Advanced Topics in the Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves*, Thm. II.6.1];
2. `j_τ₁₆₃_rational` : `j(τ₁₆₃)` has degree `h(-163) = 1` over `ℚ`, hence is rational
   [Silverman ATAEC II.4.3(b), together with `h(-163) = 1` from Buell,
   *Binary Quadratic Forms*];
3. `s₂_τ₁₆₃_rational` : `s₂(τ₁₆₃) ∈ ℚ(j(τ₁₆₃)) = ℚ`
   [Masser, *Elliptic Functions and Transcendence* (1975), Appendix A1, Thm. A1;
   Masser's `Ψ(τ)` is `(3/2)·s₂(τ)`].

Their combination `j_τ₁₆₃_integer` (a rational algebraic integer is an integer) is
what ch. 10 actually consumes, together with statement 3.

Everything else in the development (Phases A, B, D) can be completed with these as
explicit hypotheses, giving the intermediate milestone `chudnovsky_of_singular_moduli`
(PLAN Phase C).

Candidate proof routes, summarized from PLAN.md (Phase C):

1. Integrality of `j` at CM points: the classical modular-polynomial route.
   Build enough of the function-field theory of level-1 modular forms to construct
   `Φ_m ∈ ℤ[X, Y]` (q-expansion principle + elementary symmetric functions over the
   m-isogeny orbit), prove Kronecker's lemma (`Φ_m(X, X)` has unit leading coefficient
   for non-square `m`), and use the endomorphism `C·τ·L ⊆ L` of norm `m = A·C = 41` at
   `τ₁₆₃` to get `Φ₄₁(j(τ₁₆₃), j(τ₁₆₃)) = 0`. A serious standalone project, comparable
   in scale to Mathlib's existing `Δ`/`E₄`/`E₆` theory.

2. Rationality of `j(τ₁₆₃)`: `h(-163) = 1` is a finite reduced-binary-quadratic-forms
   computation (`decide`-able once form reduction is set up; small but absent from
   Mathlib). The hard part is "the conjugates of `j(τ)` are the `j(τ_Q)`" — the main
   theorem of complex multiplication; no shortcut is known within Milla's framework.

3. Rationality of `s₂(τ₁₆₃)`: Masser's own Appendix A1 proof is elliptic-function-
   theoretic (the same toolbox as the paper's Appendix B / `ComplexMult.lean`) but
   nontrivial; it needs its own outline pass before formalization.
